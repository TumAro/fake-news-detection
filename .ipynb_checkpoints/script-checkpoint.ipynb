    "# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction  \n",
    "### Background  \n",
    "Fake news has become a significant challenge in today's digital age, with misinformation spreading rapidly across social media and other platforms. Identifying and mitigating fake news is essential to ensuring the reliability of information available to the public.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation  \n",
    "With the growing influence of news on public opinion, detecting fake news using machine learning can play a crucial role in combating misinformation. This project aims to contribute to this domain by exploring effective machine learning models for fake news classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives  \n",
    "- To preprocess a dataset containing real and fake news articles.  \n",
    "- To implement machine learning models for classifying news articles as real or fake.  \n",
    "- To evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.  \n"
